 <h2>What you can do</h2>
 
 <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Notice how you feel and why. Knowing your emotions helps you understand and accept yourself. If you feel sad, notice it — but don't dwell on it too long or give it too much drama. Just tell yourself (or someone else) that you feel sad. Try to figure out why you feel that way.</li><li> Show yourself a little understanding — there's probably a good reason you feel the way you do. It's OK. Remind yourself that sadness will pass and you'll feel better.</li>
         <li> Bounce back from disappointments or failures. When things don't go your way, don't give up! Stay in the game. There's always next time. Give yourself credit for trying. Then focus on what you need to work on and try again. Keep a positive attitude.</li>
        <li>  Think positive. Even if you're sad, think of one or two good things about yourself or your situation. Believe in yourself. Think about what you can do and how things can get better. If you didn't get something you wanted, think of something else that can make you happy.<br> There's always something good — look for it!</li>
         <li> Think of solutions. Coming up with ways to solve a problem or cope with a situation can help you feel strong, confident, and good about yourself. It's hard to stay sad when you're feeling so capable!</li>
          <li>Get support. Even the most capable kids need support. The people in your life who believe in you and care (like parents, friends, and teachers) can comfort you when you feel sad. Sometimes, just listening and understanding what you're going through is enough.<br> Sometimes they can help you work out a problem or help you think of happier things to get your mind off sadness or disappointment.</li>
          <li>Put yourself in a good mood. Shake off a sad mood by doing things that put you in a more positive mood. Play a game or sport, ride a bike, dance or run, take a walk, make art or music, read, or spend time with someone you like. Relax, have some fun, and feel better.</li>
          <li>Learning to deal with sad feelings takes practice. But when you do things to take care of sadness, you make room for more positive feelings. That means a happier you!</li>
