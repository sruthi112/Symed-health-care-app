 <h2>What you can do</h2>
 
 <p>
    <ul>
        <li>		Take a time-out. Practice yoga, listen to music, meditate, get a massage, or learn relaxation techniques.<br> Stepping back from the problem helps clear your head.</li>
        <li>  	Eat well-balanced meals. Do not skip any meals. Do keep healthful, energy-boosting snacks on hand.</li>
          <li>	Get enough sleep. When stressed, your body needs additional sleep and rest.</li>
          <li>	Exercise daily to help you feel good and maintain your health. Check out the fitness tips below.</li>
          <li>Take deep breaths. Inhale and exhale slowly.</li>
          <li>	Count to 10 slowly. Repeat, and count to 20 if necessary.</li>
          <li>	Do your best. Instead of aiming for perfection, which isn't possible, be proud of however close you get.</li>
          <li>	Maintain a positive attitude. Make an effort to replace negative thoughts with positive ones.</li>
          <li>	Get involved. Volunteer or find another way to be active in your community, which creates a support network and gives you a break from everyday stress.</li>
