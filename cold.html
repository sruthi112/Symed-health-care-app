 <h2>How is it caused?</h2>
 
 <p>
    Although many types of viruses can cause a common cold, rhinoviruses are the most common culprit.<b>
    A cold virus enters your body through your mouth, eyes or nose. The virus can spread through droplets in the air when someone who is sick coughs, sneezes or talks.
