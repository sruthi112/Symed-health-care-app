 <h2>What you can do</h2>
 
 <p>
    <ul>
        <li>	Eat often to beat tiredness,
          A good way to keep up your energy through the day is to eat regular meals and healthy snacks every 3 to 4 hours, rather than a large meal less often.</li>
       <li>   Get moving,You might feel that exercise is the last thing on your mind. But, in fact, regular exercise will make you feel less tired in the long run, so you'll have more energy.<br>
          Even a single 15-minute walk can give you an energy boost, and the benefits increase with more frequent physical activity.<br>
          Start with a small amount of exercise. Build it up gradually over weeks and months until you reach the recommended goal of 2.5 hours of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, such as cycling or fast walking, every week.</li>
          <li>Lose weight to gain energy 
          If your body is carrying excess weight, it can be exhausting. It also puts extra strain on your heart, which can make you tired.<br> Lose weight and you'll feel much more energetic.
          Apart from eating healthily, the best way to lose weight and keep it off is to be more active and do more exercise.<br>
          Many people don't get the sleep they need to stay alert through the day.</li>
