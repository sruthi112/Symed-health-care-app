 <h2>How is it caused?</h2>
 
 <p>
    Most sore throats are caused by colds or the flu. A virus can cause a sore throat. These include tonsillitis, strep throat and mononucleosis (mono). Othercauses include smoking, mouth breathing at night while you sleep, pollution and allergies to pets, pollens and molds.

 <h2>How can I prevent it and cure it?</h2>
 <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Try comforting foods and beverage. Warm liquids — broth, caffeine-free tea or warm water with honey — and cold treats such as ice pops can soothe a sore throat.</li>
        <li> Humidify the air. Use a cool-air humidifier to eliminate dry air that may further irritate a sore throat, being sure to clean the humidifier regularly so it doesn't grow mold or bacteria<br> Or sit for several minutes in a steamy bathroom.</li>
        <li>Gargle with saltwater. A saltwater gargle of 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon (1.25 to 2.50 milliliters) of table salt to 4 to 8 ounces (120 to 240 milliliters) of warm water can help soothe a sore throat. </li>
