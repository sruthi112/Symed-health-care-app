 <h2>How is it caused?</h2>
 
 <p>
    Fever is the result of your immune system's response to a foreign invader. These foreign invaders include viruses, bacteria, fungi, drugs, or other toxins. These foreign invaders are considered fever-producing substances (called pyrogens), which trigger the body's immune response.

 <h2>How can I prevent it and cure it?</h2>
 <p>
    <ul>
        <li>	Wash your hands often, especially before eating, after using the toilet, and after being around large numbers of people</li>
        <li>   	Carry hand sanitizer or antibacterial wipes with you. They can come in handy when you donâ€™t have access to soap and water. Find hand sanitizers and antibacterial wipes online..</li>
        <li>   	Avoid touching your nose, mouth, or eyes. Doing so makes it easier for viruses and bacteria to enter your body and cause infection.</li>
